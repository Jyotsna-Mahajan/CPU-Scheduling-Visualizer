📘 CPU Scheduling Visualizer

A visual and interactive tool to understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms work.
Built using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project helps users visualize:

1. How processes are scheduled

2. How the CPU executes tasks

3. How completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time are calculated

Perfect for students learning Operating Systems and scheduling algorithms.

This visualizer includes:

1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)

2. SJF (Shortest Job First) – Non-Preemptive

3. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) – Preemptive

4. Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive and Preemptive)

5. Round Robin

✔ Interactive Input

Users can:

1. Add processes dynamically

2. Enter Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority (when needed)

3. Select any algorithm from the dropdown

4. Click Run to see results instantly

✔ Gantt Chart Visualization

1. Each process is shown as a separate colored block

2. The process name (P1, P2…) appears inside the block

3. The completion time labels appear below each block

4. Clean and readable scheduling output

✔ Table of Results

After execution, user gets:

1. Completion Time

2. Turnaround Time

3. Waiting Time

4. Average TurnAround Time

5. Average Waiting Time

🛠️ Tech Stack Used: 

1. React.js

2. JavaScript (ES6)

3. HTML5

4. CSS3

5. React Router (for page navigation)
